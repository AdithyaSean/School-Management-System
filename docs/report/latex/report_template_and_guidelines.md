Of course, here is the extracted information and guidelines for your final project report, presented in Markdown format.

### Project Overview

[cite_start]The System Development project is a core module for the Diploma in Software Engineering program[cite: 4]. [cite_start]It requires students to work in groups of 2-4 to solve a real-world problem by developing a software system[cite: 7, 8]. [cite_start]The project allows you to apply the concepts and skills learned throughout the course[cite: 6]. [cite_start]You can either develop new software for a manual system or enhance an existing computerized system[cite: 23, 24].

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this project, you will be able to:
* [cite_start]Define a project's scope and utilize data collection techniques[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]Analyze a given system[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]Design a system that meets specified requirements[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]Translate a system design into a functional implementation using programming[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]Apply testing strategies to verify that the system meets its requirements[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]Compose a standard project report[cite: 16].
